# Darshan: "The Code Knight Rises"
🦇 Greetings, citizens of the cybernetic underworld! I am Darshan, the Night Coder, lurking within the shadowy confines of my GitHub Batcave! 👨‍💻✨

Welcome to the sanctuary of my digital vigilance! Prepare to navigate the perilous maze of code, where every algorithm is a puzzle and every function, a piece of justice. Here's the dossier:

🔭 Currently prowling the dark recesses of React and Java, crafting digital wonders that cast a pall over bugs and glitches!

🌱 Delving into the arcane mysteries of data structures and algorithms, wielding the legendary language of Java like a beacon in the night!

👯 Calling upon stalwart allies to unite against the forces of chaos, for together, we shall disrupt the very fabric of the virtual realm!

💬 Curious about the clandestine arts of frontend sorcery or the covert escapades of academic life? Speak, and the Dark Knight shall shed light upon thy inquiries!

📫 How to send a signal in the night: darshanmrd17@gmail.com

😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His (or Dark Knight, if ye be feeling theatrical)

⚡ By the bats of Gotham! Fun fact: When I'm not waging war on the digital front, I traverse the uncharted territories of nature, seeking hidden treasures (or merely a tranquil setting for reflection)!


Fear not, for the Night Coder stands vigilant, a guardian in the shadows, ensuring that justice prevails in the realm of ones and zeros.
